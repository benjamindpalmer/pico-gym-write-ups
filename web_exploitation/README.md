# Insp3ct0r
* **Difficulty:** Easy
* **Category:** Web Exploitation
* **Author:** zaratec/danny

### Description
>Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

### Solution
This looks like a sanity check to make sure we can inspect a website. At the most basic level this involves right-clicking anywhere on the page in most browsers and opening the inspector. 

1st part of the flag is in the HTML `<body>`
> `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`

2nd part of the flag is in the style sheet - "mycss.css"
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/mycss.css
> `You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`

The 3rd part of the flag is in the javascript file. 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/myjs.js
>`/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */`

This is a nice introduction to the constituent elements of a basic website and how to use the web inspector search through the "html ball pit". Pretty easy to do with such a simple site.

### Description
>>Can you break into this super secure portal?

> **Hint:** Never trust the client
> 

### Solution
I inspected the page and found some client-side javascript right away. Oopsies. The JS appears to just check user input against a plaintext password for validation. The password (our flag) is broken up into substrings but it's not difficult to put it together.

There's probably a sexier way to patch the bits of flag together, but I just manually copied the pieces of the flag in the correct order. 

This problem looks like a simple cautionary tale in not letting your scripts just sit client side so anyone can see what they do. The in-line javascript is also probably not a good idea.

# WebDecode
* **Difficulty:** Easy
* **Category:** Web Exploitation
* **Author:** Nana Ama Atombo-Sackey

### Description
> Do you know how to use the web inspector?
> Start searching <a href="http://titan.picoctf.net:53512/">here</a> to find the flag

> **HINT:** The flag may or may not be encoded

### Solution
After launching the challenge instance and navigating to the site, I started poking around in the HTML ball pit for a little bit looking for any string that started with `picoCTF`. I checked the style sheet the same way. Nothing was jumping out at me until I took a look at the hint that indicated that the flag is probably encoded. When I started looking for an encrypted flag, I noticed a strange addtion to a the 'section' div on the about me page almost immediately.

I thanks to other challenges, I recognized `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9` as a likely Base64 encoded string.  

Copied it into CyberChef and decoded it successfully using the 'From Base64' recipe.
