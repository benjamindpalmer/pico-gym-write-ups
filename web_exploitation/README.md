### Description
>Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

### Solution
This looks like a sanity check to make sure we can inspect a website. At the most basic level this involves right-clicking anywhere on the page in most browsers and opening the inspector. 

1st part of the flag is in the HTML `<body>`
> `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`

2nd part of the flag is in the style sheet - "mycss.css"
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/mycss.css
> `You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`

The 3rd part of the flag is in the javascript file. 
https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/myjs.js
>`/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */`

This is a nice introduction to the constituent elements of a basic website and how to use the web inspector search through the "html ball pit". Pretty easy to do with such a simple site.
